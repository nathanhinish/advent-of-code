* Take a few minutes to build out the repeatable tasks. (File generation, etc)
* Step 1 is fast and dirty.
* Anticipate the changes that are likely coming in the 2nd step, but don't let it slow you down.
* Step 2 is refinement and covering new logical cases. (2021/06 is a good example)
* Precalculate what you can to keep it out of loops.
